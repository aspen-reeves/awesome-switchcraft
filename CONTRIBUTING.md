# Contribution guidelines

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

If you want an item to be added to the list, it must:

1. Be awesome.
2. Be relevant to SwitchCraft. It could be a piece of software, or an awesome tutorial. It cannot be your friend's cat's Facebook page, or good ol' Neighbor Joe's football skills.

If you have any questions about these guidelines, feel free to ask.

## Document styling

Added items should be in alphabetical order.

### List entries

For all list items, follow this format:

```md
- [My Awesome Thing](https://example.com) - An awesome thing for SwitchCraft.
```

The attached link should be the _best link available_.

### Spelling and linting

Please use American spelling unless it is a part of a name.
